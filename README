gpuman - a simple gpu manager
=============================
gpuman is a simple gpu manager for NVIDIA Optimus capable laptops written in POSIX.

Project meaning
---------------
Optimus-manager never works for me, and i want to use only my dedicated GPU sometimes. 


Dependencies
------------
gpuman assumes that you have Xorg setup, sx, doas and NVIDIA drivers installed and working properly (you can check if the NVIDIA drivers are installed properly by running `nvidia-smi`) . You can use xinit (startx) instead of sx, and sudo instead of doas through environment variables. See help for more details.


Installation
------------
copy `gpuman` onto /usr/bin or any PATH you would prefer.
